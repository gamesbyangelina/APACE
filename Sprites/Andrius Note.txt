Hi there! My name is Andrius. Contact me at andresanezin@gmail.com


If you are reading this, your probably going to use the artwork I created. Good Luck and have fun!

Sorry if you found some mistake! I did my best, working at night... lunchtimes at work... a rush, without double checking in few words :)


// Cut n' Paste Detective Contents:

- Characters A, B, C and D (Various animations)

- Shadow (All Character compatibles)

- Accesories: Gun, Shotgun, Bomb and Flashlight (All Character compatibles)

- Objects: decorations, classic stuff ;)

- Items: collectables, cursors, buttons...

- FX

- Backgrounds: 4 BKGs


//SUGGESTIONS (for the one who cares):

- I suggest fade to black for transitions in case you want a character to use a door or change to another room (?)

- Edges... evade the curves

- Use mainly desaturated colors for backgrounds in order not to lose readability

- Don't need to comply these suggestions

- May the force be with you!


Thanks to my girlfriend for her support, TIGSource communitie for the cheers and Kinetic for his advice.
